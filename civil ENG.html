<h3>Why Choose Civil Engineering?</h3>
<!--<label>Total Payment: Rs. 550,000</label>-->
<p>The Civil Engineering course is an excellent blend of science and engineering fundamental and essential practical skills. The four-year course of studies leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science of Engineering Honours in Civil Engineering is carefully designed to maintain a judicious balance between theoretical foundations and practical applications.
<br><br>
Students will be exposed to a rigorous academic programme and at the same time, they will be provided ample opportunities to gain hands-on experience in well-equipped laboratories and during exciting field excursions. The Civil Engineering program at SLIIT includes project work based on laboratory experiments, literature reviews, fieldwork and seminars. Students who follow the Civil Engineering program undergo six months of compulsory industrial training at the end of their 2nd and 3rd years, split into two periods of three months each.</p>
